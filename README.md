# Kidney Disease Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for the early detection and prediction of kidney disease using machine learning techniques. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health concern worldwide, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [provide dataset source/link]. It contains a collection of demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from patients, including features such as age, blood pressure, serum creatinine levels, and urine protein levels. The target variable is the presence or absence of kidney disease.

## Methodology

We employed a machine learning approach to develop the predictive model for kidney disease. The following steps were involved:

1. Data preprocessing:
   - Cleaning and handling missing values
   - Feature engineering and selection

2. Model selection:
   - Evaluation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, support vector machines)
   - Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation

3. Model training and evaluation:
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Training the selected model on the training data
   - Evaluating the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## Results

The predictive model achieved Stage of kidney disease, indicating its effectiveness in predicting kidney disease.
